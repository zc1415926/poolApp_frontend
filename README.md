Using cors middleware introduct in http://en.vedovelli.com.br/2015/web-development/Laravel-5-1-enable-CORS/. I seprate the Angularjs frontend from Laravel backend completely.

The backend of this app there: https://github.com/zc1415926/poolAppTutorial

Thanks of the tutorial: https://www.codetutorial.io/laravel-5-and-angularjs-tutorial-reloaded-part-1/

#Caution!!!

If you'd like to test the app, you should change the line like $http.get('http://192.168.19.31/api/pool'). to you own url in /app/js/controller/PoolController.js
